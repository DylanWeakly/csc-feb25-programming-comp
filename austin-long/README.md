# Austin's Programs

This describes the files and what they mean for my directory in the CSC Spring Programming
Competition on 2/21/2025.

## `austin-long`

The Python (`*.py`) files in this directory (`./austin-long`) contain challenges completed
within the deadline. The following directories are subdirectories of this directory.

## `past-deadline`

Because the competition started 15 minutes after it was originally going to start, I thought
that it also ended 15 minutes later. That is why there are 4 `past-deadline` programs.
`medium-30.py` was started before the deadline and was completed 3 minutes after.
Here is the times (CT) that all the files were last modified (completed):

| Time      | Filename                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `3:56:24` | `easy-18.py`                 |
| `4:04:29` | `medium-26.py`               |
| `4:13:20` | `medium-29.py`               |
| `4:46:46` | `medium-31.py`               |
| `5:06:33` | `medium-28.py`               |
| `5:14:54` | `medium-32.py`               |
| `5:20:37` | `medium-35.py`               |
| `5:26:55` | `medium-37.py`               |
| `5:33:06` | `past-deadline/medium-30.py` |
| `5:34:59` | `past-deadline/easy-8.py`    |
| `5:36:24` | `past-deadline/easy-10.py`   |
| `5:36:45` | `past-deadline/easy-13.py`   |

## `practice` Directory

This directory can be ignored. It contains practice challenges that I was doing to prepare for
this competition.

## `dev` Directory

This directory can also be ignored. It contains the script that I was going to use to submit my
completions. Unfortunately, I lacked internet connection during the competition, so this script
went unused.

## This File

This file was created, with much pain, with TextEdit (the macOS equivalent of Notepad).
This is because of a deal me and Breyon made before the competition: if I beat him, he would
have to use Vim for 24 hours instead of VSCode, and if he beat me, I would have to use TextEdit
for 24 hours. Do you have any idea how long it took me to format that table above, Breyon?!
